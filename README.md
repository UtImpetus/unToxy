Binaries
===
Pre-compiled versions of Toxy can be found [here](http://jenkins.impy.me/ "Toxy Binaries"). Those include all of the dependencies.

Things you'll need to compile
===

* The [SharpTox library](https://github.com/Impyy/SharpTox "SharpTox GitHub repo") and its dependencies. 
* The [SharpTox.Vpx library](https://github.com/Impyy/SharpTox.Vpx)
* Once you have obtained those, place libtox.dll, SharpTox.dll and SharpTox.Vpx.dll in the libs folder.

All other dependencies can be found in the packages.config file and should be downloaded by Visual Studio automatically
